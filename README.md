# AI Chatbot
This repository contains the code for an AI chatbot that uses OpenAI's GPT-3.5 Turbo model to generate responses. The chatbot can carry on a conversation with users and provide answers to a variety of questions.

#Features
The chatbot is trained on a large corpus of text data, allowing it to generate natural and coherent responses.
Users can interact with the chatbot through a simple and intuitive web interface powered by Gradio.

The chatbot can answer a wide range of questions, from general knowledge queries to more specific topics.

#Getting Started
